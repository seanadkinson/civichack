To run the application, open Terminal
> cd ~/work/rumormill
> export NODE_ENV=development
> node app.js

When making CSS changes, open Terminal (or Command+T for new tab)
> cd public/
> compass watch

Only edit public/sass/*.scss files for CSS changes
 - The public/css/*.css files are compiled from the .scss

CSS changes will NOT require a restart

Templates are in views/*.hjs, which is just mustache syntax
Changes to the template DO require a restart

To bust cache:
- Edit app.js
- Find APP_VERSION
- Increment the number

To restart the server
 - From the first terminal tab (running "node app.js")
 - Push Ctrl+C to quit
 - Hit UP, and ENTER, to re-run "node app.js"

To pull the latest changes
> cd ~/work/rumormill
> git stash
> git pull
> git stash pop

If you ever end up with a strange dialog after pulling (you are committing the merge)
- Press ":wq"
This completes the "merge commit"

When ready to commit
> cd ~/work/rumormill
> git status   <-- View what files you have touched
> git add .
> git commit -m "SOME MESSAGE"
> git push origin master

When ready to push live (AFTER "git commit")
> git push heroku master


That's it
